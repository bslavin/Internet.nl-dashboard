        For convenience purposes a calculation field also contains some hints why the rating is
        the way it is.

    -   It increases speed
        Instead of continuously calculating the score, it is done on a more regular interval: for
        example once every 10 minutes and only for the last 10 minutes.

    A time dimension is kept, since it's important to see what the rating was over time. This is
    now very simple to get (you don't need a complex join which is hard in django).

    The client software does a drill down on domains and shows why things are the way they are.
    Also this should not know too much about different scanners. In OO fashion, it should ask a
    scanner to explain why something is the way it is (over time).
