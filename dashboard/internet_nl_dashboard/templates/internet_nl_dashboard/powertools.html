    <h1>Powertools</h1>
    <p>Some nice power user features. These are unpolished and unrestricted features that can do great things, and
    shoot you in the foot really hard.</p>

    <h3>About Users, DashboardUsers and Accounts</h3>
    <p>This system knows users, dashboardusers and account. This might be confusing at first, and this might help
    you getting started.</p>
    <p>Anyone that can log into this system has a user account. The standard user account has been extended a bit:
    it makes it possible to become part of a larger 'Account'.</p>
    <p>The larger Account holds the list with urls and has reports associated to it. This way multiple users can
    work on the same set of data.</p>
