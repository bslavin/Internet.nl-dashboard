# done: create more flexible filters
# done: map mail scans to an endpoint (changed the scanner for it)
# done: make nice tracking name for internet nl that is echoed in the scan results.
# done: map web scans to endpoints
# done: check status of scan using each individual account
# done: possibly we need to check all relevant endpoints before starting the scan. This makes sure that all
#       latest changes have been picked up. Especially if manual scans will happen a lot. Probably just adding
#       a task before registering a scan. This might deliver some problems as we've seen before, with a chord
#       not being performed after the other task has finished. This might be a bit challenging.
#       Indeed: a chord does not work. A chain might. We can verify url filters when there is a larger set of domains.
#       Done: How do we get the correct list of urls at the time we're going to scan? We've to make that a task too.
#       Done: This is done using chains, where each step is executed in order.
# done: create a function for this, as it is twice the same code.
# todo: probably the urllist will contain information if a scan will be done for web or mail. This cannot be managed
#       yet, so this is not implemented yet.
