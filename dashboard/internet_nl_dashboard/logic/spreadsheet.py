"""
Handles spreadsheet uploads.

About spreadsheet sizes:
10.000 urls in a test came down to 51 kilobytes (many of the same urls, is compressed).
10.000 unique urls is 80 kilobytes. We don't need to change the upload size to something larger than 2MB.

Types supported through pyexcel: xlsx, xls, ods.

DONE: handle file uploads
DONE: validation (as far as that goes)
DONE: support ods
DONE: support xls, xlsx
DONE: support CSV
Removed: support JSON.
DONE: give example files.
DONE: supply example download files.
