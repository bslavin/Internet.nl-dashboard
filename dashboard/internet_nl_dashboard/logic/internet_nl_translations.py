    Uses polib to get the contents of a .po file. This file is then 'mangled' into a vue i18n object. This
    object is stored as a .vue file and can be included in your views (or your views can connect to it).

    The upside is that translations from internet.nl get a place here. The downside is that when they delete a key
    or things change drastically, the keys will be missing here.

    done: verify that when the entire translation is missing / empty, the application continues to function with
          just the ugly labels or fallback labels. -> Yes, this happens. It's ugly, but it still works.

    done: where will the generated files be placed? -> static/js/translations/
    done: download the file from the remote location
    done: how to share i18n objects within vue from different sources? Can just be called using the path...
          So you can just in your own i18n reuse previously defined translations.
    done: how to dynamically support multiple languages? And how does the i18n object doesn't become insanely big?
          -> just load them into the same file. The language file for NL and EN is now 300 kb and will grow 150 kb
          per language. There will be a moment when it's just too much and languages need to be loaded dynamically.
          For now there is no option to do that yet.
    done: should we merge all translation files into one? probably... -> yes, this is now happening and it
          doesn't scale. All languages are also saved separately. It's not clear how to dynamically load them.
          Up until 1 MB of languages is probably fine.
    done: Remove some of the larger variables we're not going to use anyway (we can just point to internet.nl for that
          content). This saves about 50 kilobyte per language. Each language is now about 100kb with relevant content.
